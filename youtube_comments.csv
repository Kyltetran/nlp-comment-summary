It’s interesting how different countries handle population control. Vietnam’s policy aimed to balance population growth with economic development, but it never reached the extreme measures seen in China. Do you think this policy has had a lasting impact on Vietnamese society?",

The car division has started EV taxi fleets firstly in city's but now expanding.
There is also medical tourism as new hospitals come on line with the latest equipment, Vietnamese have easy access to these facility's that are covered by Government and insurance based schemes. The UK has a 2 week waiting list just to see a GP doctor, where as I wait 20 mins max.

In Southeast Asia, the countries that are not worth paying attention to:

Myanmar: the vast separation between Southeast Asia and South Asia (the dirtiest, most decayed region in the world).

Philippines: not a purely East Asian country but a mix of cultures, lifestyles, and languages from different continents.

Cambodia: essentially a flawed version of Southern Vietnam, with dark skin and small stature, very inferior, and will forever remain behind Vietnam.

Indonesia: a large Islamic country with a closed-off lifestyle, located right on the equator, with very dark skin and unappealing appearance.

Brunei and East Timor: too small and insignificant to even be mentioned, easily forgotten.

According to official figures, our Party has 5.4 million official Communist Party members and 5.7 million Youth Union members (Communist Youth). In each family, there is at least one ‘Communist.’ Being admitted to the Party is an immense honor for every Vietnamese citizen. This country is led by Communists, which is completely obvious, because the country is led by the entire Vietnamese people, who select the most elite and outstanding individuals to be ‘cadres’ and higher ‘leaders.’ The leadership principle of the Communist Party is ‘collective leadership, individual responsibility.’ These ‘cadres’ are not powerful officials but remain ‘loyal servants of the people,’ as our great leader instructed, clearly demonstrating our democracy. Additionally, our Communist Party’s highest mission and goal is ‘Rich people, strong country, democracy, justice, and civilization,’ and we will do everything we can to achieve this noble and glorious mission.

Only one thing i am concern is the corruption of government officials and police but it will also be solved gradually as the country becomes more stable.

Also, one thing I noticed about Vietnam is that unlike some other ASEAN countries, who put more values on families and lesasures, Vietnamese are really industrious people. In other words, they study and work really hard.

Which is similar to my country (South Korea), we were work and study animals for last 50 years, that makes South Korea developed. However, there will be side effect. It will make people become depressed which will lead high suicidal rate and low birth late in the future.

Vietnam's neutrality in this conflict and differing values could lead to significant trade reductions if a right-wing U.S. administration wins the election.

Officially, there's no market, but you can technically created private firms through cooperatives (Hợp tác xã). Black markets were rampaging through Cambodia and Laos, not to mention the long coastline which makes it difficult for border control. The Government decided Vietnam cannot be like China (too small of a domestic market for a special ""communism"" ideology, too geographically open to be like North Korea or Cuba), so they officially announced Doi Moi to bring forth privatization so they can actually earn taxes. A key insight is that Le Duan, the hardline Communist who was actually believed to be the main leader instead of Ho Chi Minh during the Vietnam - American war, also died in 1986.",

The vast majority of my coworkers at the time were addicted gamblers, owning tens of millions VND because of their online gambling. Worst of all was the managers, which refuse to pay employees when the time is due, plus them being shady about salary days, originally they said new employees get to borrow 100k VND a day the first month that'd be taken from their paycheck and by the 1st of each month they'd be paid 2m VND beforehand. However, they refused to pay my 2mVND citing that I've exceeded the borrowing limit of 2m, despite them never told anything about the maximum amount of money I can borrow, and have been refusing to pay me ever since even though I've quit

And this isn't just me, alot of grab drivers on the streets you see actually are college graduates with no way to find job for the majors they've studied for, most of them live in horrible condition similar to my own, sometime even worse

Corruption, gang violence and smuggling aee all common in Viet Nam, ESPECIALLY in the goverment, soldiers would have their monthly payment cut by HALF by the first few months, normally they would fished up dead, decaying fish to be cooked and served up as daily meal, officers would ask for money to buy ""new equipments"" despite the equipments from previous year were still viable, or ""fee for kitchen fuel"" despite they were collecting unwated firewoods from the local, and assaults both verbally and physcially are COMMON in the military, even to death in some cases. Officers would deliberately mess up the training schedule to ""meet the quota"" which lead to dozens of cases of injuries and hospitalizations, I witness 4 separare occasions. Drug and contrabands like cigarettes being smuggled and used days and nights, there was an active smuggling route right in front of my base camp running day and night, I saw no less than 10 man sized packages full of cigarettes being transported pass our guard post by the daily. There were at least 2 drug dealers in my platoon alone, one of them have had run ins with police in the pass and the vast majority of them are heavy smoker and gangsters, with two separate incident of chaotic brawl happened when I was in service, with DOZENS of other incidents ranging anywhere from abandoning posts during guard duty, unauthorised consumptions of alcohol, and a mass desertion where nearly a third of the company snuck out to the local karaoke, that was not including the other individual flounderingz in my company alone

Secondly, it was not until 1989 that Vietnam was not be attacked by Chinese anymore. Furthermore, Vietnam was isolated and not be able to join the global market until 1994, when the United State eventually lifted the embargo on Vietnam. Formal normalization occurred in one year after-1995. Therefore, it is clear that Vietnam has a very limited time to develop, just about 30 years. Making comparison between Vietnam's economy and other Asian nations is apparently irrational. For example, as Thailand has not be invaded since 1945, this country has almost... 80 years.",

Các bạn trẻ, các cơ quan chính phủ hay các tổ chức bên ngoài hoàn toàn có thể lấy video này để tham khảo cho hướng phát triển sau này. Tuy nhiên mình vẫn còn thấy các hạn chế của video như sau: 
1. Việc phát triển kinh tế của VN nên được đánh giá bắt đầu từ năm 1995 khi VN-Mỹ bình thường hóa quan hệ, lúc này VN mới được xem là bắt đầu chạy đua cho phát triển kinh tế. Còn trước đó chỉ nên được coi là để ổn định kinh tế, xã hội, chính trị bởi VN khi này còn chịu các lệnh cấm vận thì lương thực, hàng hóa thiếu thốn mọi người tập trung vào việc ""Sống"" thì làm sao nghĩ đến ""Kinh doanh"". 
2. Việc đề cập VN là một đất nước không đề cao ""Quyền con người"" là không đúng. Về quyền tự do dân sự của người Việt hoàn toàn được bảo đảm. Người Việt hoàn toàn được tiếp cận mọi thông tin trên thế giới qua Google, Facebook, Youtube, TikTok, Telegram, Wechat,...đọc trên các trang báo phương Tây như BBC hay CNN, chúng tôi biết về chiến tranh Nga-Ukraina, Palestine-Israel, các bất ổn ở các khu vực như chính trị ở Myanmar, nông nghiệp ở EU thậm chí là các bài biện chứng, các lập trường khác biệt về chủ nghĩa Cộng Sản. Người Việt cũng không có vấn đề lớn liên quan đến tôn giáo, ở VN có hầu hết các tôn giáo trên thế giới như Phật giáo, Thiên chúa giáo, Đạo tin lành, Hồi giáo, thậm chí người Việt còn có ""đạo ông bà"" để thờ cúng tổ tiên. VN chưa hề có vấn nạn liên quan đối xử về khác biệt tôn giáo, màu da, phân biệt giữa người bản địa và người dân từ các quốc gia khác. Các dân tộc thiểu số của VN cũng được chính phủ hỗ trợ rất nhiều, học sinh là người thuộc các dân tộc thiểu số luôn được ưu ái khi thi đại học thậm chí có những học bổng 80-100% chi phí học tập dành riêng cho người thuộc dân tộc thiểu số và người Lào, Campuchia.",

So now everywhere there are people who hate the Viet Cong communists. Vietnamese people cannot stop silently. The old proverb left by our grandparents is that WHO IS IN EVIL WILL FIND EVIL.

1. Vietnam grew faster than India basically the entire time after the Vietnam War ended
2. Vietnam's economic growth spurt is definitely because of it's Communist government's policies. Growth doesn't just come out of nowhere because of the people. Otherwise, there would be little difference betweeen policy changes before and after those policies are implemented. Typical propaganda by anti-Communists. LOL",

@huytranvan2754,"As a Vietnamese, short answer: ""No, we won't be 'rich' and will always be miles behind more developed countries, unless things change"". 

Longer answer:
""The political system in Vietnam, like in many countries, is too corrupt top-down. This hinders the country from becoming prosperous in the long-term. The major reasons why Vietnam's economy is doing 'well' right now is because of foreign capital flight from China, globalization and because we have 'golden population' where most people are young = cheap labor.
 When the cheap labor dries up due to aging population as well as having brain-drain because the younger, more educated individuals seek better economics abroad, we will just end up miserable and poor again. The effect is especially severe for developing countries like Vietnam since the current demographic isn't innovative enough to invent new ideas to be competitive globally and we rely too much on cheap labor for secondary and primary sector exports to stay afloat... (also known as 'Middle Income trap').
 Again, unless there's a miracle struck of luck where we have strong, benevolent and competent leaders that actually reform the corrupt system and 'unplug' the old 'communist'-style party and allow more 'democratic' power structure in the foreseeable future, there's absolutely no chance that Vietnam's economic 'miracle' can have long lasting effect. 

So as a Vietnamese, I say take advantage of the opportunity while it lasts... :P""",

@thethaovatoquoc312,"As long as Vietnam is still ruled by the oppressive and exploitive Communist regime, her potential remains greatly diminished. For any 1% that wants to stay, 99% of the population wants to get out, and many have risked their lives doing just that (for example, 39 doomed lives found in UK container truck recently on the news, and that's only what's been reported), unfortunately. Yet another shocking and also recent example is that during the Covid pandemic when almost all countries assisted their citizens with financial aids in one form or another, the corrupt and murderous Vietnamese Commie regime saw it just as another opportunity not to help but to exploit its ruled citizens even more, essentially making money over the corpses of its citizens by presumably killing at least 30-50K of them, due to grossly misdiagnoses and being thrown into barbwired unhygenic living quarters for isolation, so that they had to sleep on concrete floor, even next to filled trashcans, with inadequate toilet, food, water, or medicine, like animals (searching hard enough, one is able to see shocking video clips on Facebook though the regime tried hard to crack down the leaks by Vietnamese citizen journalists), with the fake nostril Covid test kits, mislabeled as approved by World Health Organization (WHO) in Việt Á scandal, colluded by at least 4 different government agencies (Y Tế , Khoa Học, Công Nghệ, Quân y) and the top Politburo members, including Nguyễn Phú Trọng, Phạm Minh Chính, Nguyễn Xuân Phúc. Murderous Vietnamese Commie regime even had a thug murdered Christian pastor Giuse Trần Ngọc Thanh, like it has done with many other pastors across the nation. There is a reason why the current Commie Vietnam ranks at the bottom of the world in freedom of speech, (true) freedom of religion, and freedom of the press, barely above Commie China and Commie North Korea. There is no true freedom of religion in Commie Vietnam, as this corrupt Vietnamese Commie regime only authorized the fake organizations headed by Commie monks, many of whom were Commie Party officials, and those religious organizations not approved to be infiltrated by them or headed by their Commie agents are accused of malicious and nonexistent crimes and banned, with innocent religious leaders arrested and jailed, as in the recent case with Thiền Am Bên Bờ Vũ Trụ, a harmless Buddhist meditation monastery, for simply having many followers (hence, more influences that the regime fears it can't control) than the Commie Party's officially approved ones. Similarly, its passport ranks at the bottom, 89th out of 111 countries for a reason, barely above North Korea 104th rank. even below many African nations. For comparison, South Korea is at 2nd rank. That's what Republic of South Vietnam would have likely been ranked among at least the top 10 had it not been invaded and occupied by the North Vietnamese Commie terrorists, aided by Commie Soviet and Commie China. Search ""cuop dat dan"" (meaning ""land-robbing of citizens"") to see millions of footages across the country from North to South, spanning for decades, dated back to Ho Chi Minh's bloody land reform 1953-1956 that killed nearly 1 million North Vietnamese in only 4 years, or 250K people brutally slaughtered in torturous painful deaths (like being shot, stabbed, mutilated while being alive, or heads being plowed over by water buffaloes while bodies being buried underground) each year on average to rob their lands and homes. Even today, if the rightful owners refuse to have their homes or lands robbed, the ruthless Vietnamese Commie terrorist regime simply jail or massacre them, have tractors run over their bodies or openly assassinate them in their own homes. When it comes to robbing, these barbarian Vietnamese Commie bandits even prey on each other, just as the recent case with then 84-year-old Mr. Lê Đình Kình, a 55-year-Commie Party veteran from Dong Tam, near Hanoi, that got shot dead at 3am in his own home by the Vietnamese Commie terrorist regime. When his wife Mrs. Dư Thị Thành refused to lie about the incident as ordered, the Vietnamese Commie terrorist police brutally tortured her (see more details from ""dandongtam"" on Facebook). The corrupt Vietnamese Commie government officials routinely dine on lavish gold-plated Salt Bae steak $100K per meal with blood money not just from taxpayers but also from robbed-lands and robbed homes recently drew international condemnations, while many Vietnamese citizens, including elderlies in their 60's and 70's as well as kids as young as 6's to 16's selling lottery tickets on the streets to survive on $2-3 per day. Even Phạm Nhật Vượng the richest man in Vietnam (via his VinGroup) made the bulk of his wealth mainly by colluding with the barbarian Vietnamese Commie regime in selling their robbed-lands from Vietnamese citizens. Travelers to Vietnam in her current form (not at all like this before the Communists took over) should keep this in mind. Behind the beauty of the land and smiling faces at popular tourist destinations, there are a lot of darkness and tears, bloods, sweats, sorrow, horror, and sufferings all over the country.",

The nation that once defeated the United States is a nation that should not be underestimated. they are a strong nation.

they are hardworking and ambitious. as a citizen of one of the ASEAN countries, I see Vietnam in how they build their football power. In the last 15 years, no one would have thought that their football strength could become what it is today, becoming the best in ASEAN. Even Vietnamese football is better than Chinese. they are known to be more ambitious than other ASEAN countries. 

Their communist country is known to be more stable than democracies like Indonesia or the Philippines.

@takumifujiwara2839,所谓的自由民主国家之所以富裕，那是因为大多数“自由民主”国家在大航海时代和工业时代对其他国家进行了十分彻底的侵略与掠夺，所谓的“自由民主”是发生在二战之后，60年代这些国家的女人甚至还没有选举权，在英国工业革命最如火如荼的时候，儿童和劳动者却在以极快的速度死亡。换言之，自由民主国家的富裕是建立在掠夺与剥削之上，而衰落却是伴随着“自由民主”极端左派的崛起，看欧洲就能明白这一点。美国还保持了侵略者和战争贩子的本色，所以至今依然能够保有大量财富。,

That.combined with the sanctions is what held back the Vietnamese economy.

The CPV always wanted to lift its people out of poverty.  The whole capitalism/liberal democracy good and socialist economy bad narrative is BS.  Japan benefited significantly from US investments.   Indonesia was under a brutal US backed dictatorship for decades, China is politically socialist while being hybrid economy.

Vì bạn đã có ý định thế nên mình sẽ đưa thông số công bố online cho bạn có vẻ không có lòng yêu nước với Tổ Quốc hiểu nha ^^.

1. Việt Nam hiện tại trong năm mình đang viết là 49 năm được Thống nhất, bị cấm vận và bị hạn chế giao dịch cho đến năm 1994. Trong 1975-1994, mình phải trải qua 2 cuộc chiến tranh nữa. Chắc bạn yêu BIẾT VÀ KHÔNG QUÊN 2 CUỘC CHIẾN ĐÓ LÀ GÌ CHỨ NHỈ?
2. Bạn nghĩ thông qua chiến tranh, tái thiết lập 1 quốc gia đẫm máu chiến tranh đau thương là dễ? Khi vô vàn người tri thức đã ngã xuống ( Ví dụ Thành Cổ Quảng Trị ), bạn nghĩ  Đảng phải làm gì để khôi phục lại để người dân ấm no?
3. Việt Nam hiện tại từ một quốc gia với tỷ lệ nghèo đói thảm hoạ chấn động 70% -> 5.75% trong 49 năm. Bạn có thể làm được không? À mà quên, xin lỗi bạn yêu là kẻ /// này sao mà có dám cống hiến gì cho Tổ Quốc.
4. Nghèo đói, đau thương, không nhà không cửa ở đâu cũng có. Muốn giúp thì phải trước tiên phải giỏi, phải có tài, phải cống hiến rất nhiều để những người nghèo có cái cần câu để kiếm ăn chứ không phải cứ đưa tiền rồi để họ tự hết nghèo. Cường Quốc trên thế giới vẫn còn phải vắt óc suy nghĩ, vẫn chưa giải quyết xong bên họ thì bạn đang có yêu cầu quá đáng bên mình không hả?

Bạn chủ comment đầu nói là đúng, hầu hết nơi bạn đi nhân dân đều đã có thể ăn no mặc ấm, có một nơi để trú và nghĩ dưỡng. Mắc mớ gì bạn phải phủ định công lao của Tổ Quốc thế? 5% cũng đâu phải con số cao? Thật ra nó là một con số rất thấp, và nếu mình không phải dính Covid thì mình đã giảm xuống 4% rồi. Bạn có thể nhìn bản đồ nghèo đói thế giới, bạn sẽ thấy Việt Nam mình nằm ở vị trí % khá ổn, rất ổn so với mặt bằng chung thế giới. Thế bạn còn muốn đòi hỏi gì nữa từ Tổ Quốc?

However, as the video layout, and i mostly agree with the problems it mention, the question is, can vietnam be a rich country? My answer is..unlikely, very unlikely. My reason is vietnam is getting more politically unstable and corruption is getting worse. People in vietnam is actually losing faith in the communist party and the north - south dividend is getting worse because of unfair treatment across southern provinces by channeling all taxes to build the north leaving the south to fence for themself. In 2 years, our country has ousted 2 presidents, 1 Nation Assembly Chairman, and so many more of high ranking in the party. The propaganda machine in vietnam is getting ever closer to Russia, Iran and North Korea, all from State Medias, which is saying something, especially on the ukraine and israel gaza war. As a common sense and a logical person would, soon outsider will take notice of this and make judgement for themself. Its not hard to see where this is heading in the furure and we can make prediction. Plus the aging economy and middle income trap will not give my country the time it need to achieve it.
