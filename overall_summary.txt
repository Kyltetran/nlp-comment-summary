The Mazda CX-5 has been a popular choice among car enthusiasts, with many owners praising its sporty performance, advanced features, and reliability. However, some owners have raised concerns about the vehicle's CVT transmission, citing issues such as oil dilution and costly repairs. Consumer Reports has consistently rated Mazda as one of the most reliable brands in various model years, including 2022.

Many owners have reported problems with the CVT transmission, particularly with the 2.5L engine in certain models from 2020 and 2021. These issues include oil dilution, which can lead to expensive repairs. In contrast, the CX-5's 6-speed automatic transmission has been praised for its reliability.

Despite these issues, many owners have reported no problems with their Mazda CX-5s, citing factors such as regular maintenance, careful driving habits, and favorable weather conditions. Others have noted that the vehicle's sporty performance and advanced features make it a worthwhile investment.

Overall, the sentiment among owners is mixed, with some praising the CX-5's reliability and others warning about potential issues with the CVT transmission. While Mazda has consistently been rated as one of the most reliable brands, owners are advised to carefully research their vehicle model and consider regular maintenance to minimize the risk of costly repairs.

Some owners have noted that Subaru's Lineartronic CVT is more reliable than the Mazda's, citing its use of a chain instead of a belt. Regular fluid changes, including the CVT fluid, can also help extend the life of the transmission. Ultimately, the decision to purchase a Mazda CX-5 should be based on careful research and consideration of individual needs and driving habits.
