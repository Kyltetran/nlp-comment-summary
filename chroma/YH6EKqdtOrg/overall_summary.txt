The comments section of the video discussion reveals a range of opinions and experiences with Mazda vehicles, particularly the CX-5 and Subaru models. Many owners praise their respective cars for their reliability, performance, and features. For example, someone owns a 2016 CX-5 with nearly 100k miles and highly recommends it, while another owner of a 17-year-old Subaru Forester mentions that they have no major issues with their car.

However, some comments express concerns about the quality of certain Mazda models. Some owners report problems with the CVT transmission, such as oil consumption and reliability issues. One comment even warns others to avoid purchasing a diesel 2.2 CX-5 from 2012-2014 versions due to potential engine and turbine issues.

There are also discussions about interior space and off-road capability, particularly for taller drivers or those who prioritize adventure driving. Some owners recommend the Subaru Forester or Outback for these needs, while others prefer the Mazda CX-9 or consider alternative brands like Toyota or Honda.

Overall, the comments section reflects a mix of enthusiasm and caution when it comes to buying Mazda vehicles. While some owners have positive experiences with their cars, others report issues that may deter potential buyers. The diversity of opinions highlights the importance of researching and test-driving a vehicle before making a purchase decision.
