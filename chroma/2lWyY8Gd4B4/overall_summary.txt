Here is a summary of the YouTube comment excerpt:

The comments section appears to be related to a video that may have been uploaded as part of a birthday celebration or a special event. The majority of comments are in Arabic, with some English responses from users who seem to be watching the video and responding to it. Many comments express gratitude, appreciation, and enthusiasm for the content shared in the video. For example, @raziftarafder193 and @Malakk07 both use emojis to thank the creator and celebrate a "Teamie" ( likely a nickname or inside joke). 

Some users also expressed amusement, such as @itZ_Alicia.X's multiple ðŸ˜‚ responses. Another user, @alzamhidayatullah4028, used phrases like "Ajg lucu kocak" which translates to "This is really funny". The video seems to have generated a lighthearted and playful atmosphere among viewers.

There are also comments that seem unrelated to the content of the video, such as @nixly9218's declaration of being an "INDIAN", or @carolineotunga5517's enthusiastic response to something called "Kuja ona". It is unclear what these comments refer to without more context. 

Overall, the comments suggest a positive and appreciative audience that enjoys the content shared in the video.
